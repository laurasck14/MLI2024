    "The administration of the nature park Montesinho wants to **predict wild fires based on wheather data of the Fire-Wheather-Index (FWI)**. The aim is to recognize the affected area and consequently the intensity of the imminent wild fire as early as possible in order to be able to adequatly assess the danger caused by the fire.\n",

    "Data: \n",
    "    Collected from 517 wild fires containing following features: \n",
    "\n",
    "    X       X-coordinate of the fire in the park: 1 to 9 \n",
    "    Y       Y-coordinate of the fire in the park: 2 to 9 \n",
