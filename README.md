# Intelligent Data Analysis and Machine learning
Intelligent data Analysis and machine learning I 2024 course from the University of Potsdam Msc Bioinformatics

The goal was to analyse some provided data using the methods studied during the lecture. The selected dataset is from forest fires in a natural park in Portugal where different Fire Weather Indexes (FWI) were measure. The task was to predict the burned area using the FWI provided.
I implemented two linear models (simple and with Ridge regularization) and a random forest regressor to try and predict the burned area. The implemented models did not result in any relevant results that can predict the burned area, however the tunining performed did help with some slight increased performance.
